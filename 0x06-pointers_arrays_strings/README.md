Write a function that concatenates two strings. prototype; char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n); the _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that it will use at most n bytes from src; and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes return a pointer to the resulting string dest FYI; the standard library provides a similar function; strncat. run man strncat to learn more
